# Levanta üöÄ

Levanta is a tough-love motivational SMS bot that pushes you to stay consistent with your daily LeetCode grind.  
Every day at 12 PM, it sends you a sarcastic, FOMO-inducing motivational text *plus* a random unsolved LeetCode problem to work on.  
No excuses. No mercy. Just accountability.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Daily SMS reminders** at a fixed time using GitHub Actions (cron jobs).
- **Brutal motivational messages** generated with Cohere‚Äôs `command-a-03-2025` model.
- **Unique real-life examples** (e.g., Cl√©ment Mihailescu, Marie Curie, Thomas Edison) ‚Äî never repetitive.
- **Dynamic problem assignment**: pulls unsolved problems from your GitHub LeetCode repo and assigns one each day.
- **Twilio integration**: sends reminders straight to your phone.
- **History tracking**: remembers past messages to avoid repeats.

   She didn't wait for a fairy godmother, she wrote every damn day.
